# CATLight (Creativity Art Technology)

This is MARK 2 of the new and shiny ESP32-S2 driven flat flashlight (aka flatlight)

This is a close proximity Flashlight, it has no lense to focus a beam, but it smoothly lights up a wide field around you. I find it perfect for indoor usage (searching dark drawers in the cellar and so on, but it also lights your way to the shed at night..)

Features : 
- USB-C power delivery standard realized with a MAX77751 (fast charge + PD (boost mode 5V up to 1 Amp))
- ESP32-S2 with wifi etc...
- 1.2 " TFT SPI color display
- 1 IMU LSM6DS3 or LSM6DSM .. both will work with slight changes in the initialization
- 1 CREE XLAMP with a DIO5661 flash driver and protective lens (no focus) that delivers up to 1.5 Amps into the XLAMP.. makes for a nice foto flash ..
- 16 neopixels on there 2 rows by 8.. i think it is possible to realize a POV display with it since there also is a LSM6DS3 IMU on there.
- 10 Duris high power LEDs (100mA each) this is the main light source (300 mA J-Series are no longer available.. sadly !)
- 4 TEMP sensors on the light. 2 NTCs close to critical places (XLAMP and Duris LEDS) 1 in the ESP itself and on in the IMU.

The last flatlight revision was 20.
So this would be the flatlight REV 21 aka CATLight MK2

## This Revision works ! 

... with no errors as far as I can see and test (I own no OSZI ;))

There is one thing though... the Antenna matching Network works better if you put a cap in series and the coil in the first place to ground. (swap C24 with L3)

This revision works with WLED beta 2 (0.13.0-b2) there are filesystem issues, but the default install seems to work and you can save the LED settings and power off / on again and it maintains theses settings even there is no "official" support for the ESP32-S2 yet.
MAYBE I will fork and branch and modify and write a usermod for wled in the future. Maybe...
For now there is rudimentary arduino firmware in the arduino folder.
There is a platformio_override.ini in the base Folder I used to compile WLED with in code OSS with platformio under arch linux.


#### WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! 

DO NOT put too much capacitance on the LED side, it will mess with the soft latch ! 1µF per duris LED is sufficient and works.
If you put a lot of high value CAPs on the LED side you need to lower the value of R5. (1.2KΩ with 25 µF on the LED side. Flash and array)

the duris LEDs are mosfet driven and that is their ONE and ONLY current limiter, a duty cycle of 30 % on a full lipo makes a nice bright light.
if you pull up the mosfet with 100 % duty cycle it make a smoldered PCB with the LEDs falling off and molten solder dripping everywhere... 
probably a good idea to keep that in mind when fumbling with the firmware...
___

there is a footprint for additional flash memory with a solder bridge CS0/CS1 parallel to the internal flash. if you have an ESP32-S2 without flash you can put a flash chip here (AT256Q i think) please refer to the flash compatibility list for the ESP32-S2 on the espressif website.

wifi standby time with a genuine LIPO Battery is 60+ hours

USB-C fast charging works up to 2.5 Ampere !! (almost full in 60 minutes ;))
the MAX 77751 supports pass through and power delivery, so you can charge your phne on the light in an emerrgency !

Please keep in mind that this project is my private experiment and CC-BY-NC-SA !
If you blow up your toaster .. not my fault.

the overall development cost was 600 €, the cost per CATLight (PCB + parts + 3dprint) is around 50 € assembly time is 6-8 hours if you do it 100% by hand.

Have fun emitting Bosons of differend wavelenght..
